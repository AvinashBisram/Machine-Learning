Classification Model Comparison
===============================


This project is currently in-progress. The goal is create a model capable of correctly classifying records with sufficient accuracy. It will take a relatively clean dataset and discuss the intuition behind various classification models (Single Decision Tree, Random Forest Classification, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, Support Vector Machines, KNN). For each model, their hyperparameters will be optimized to achieve the best performance on the training data (using cross-validation) whereafter each model's performnace will be evaluated. After which, the best performing model will be selected and the performance generalized for the testing set before productionizing the model using JobLib.
