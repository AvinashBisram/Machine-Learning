Predicting Insurance Costs with Multiple Linear Regression
=================================================

**Description:** This project attempts to create a Multiple Linear Regression ML model capable of predicting insurance costs based on patient information (age, sex, bmi, smoking status, number of children, and region of residence). A medical insurance cost dataset is explored, cleaned, visualized, and preprocessed before being used to train a Multiple LinReg model (with hyper-parameter optimization). Performance of the model is evaluated and discussed in terms of overall insights gained and accuracy.

**Language(s):** Python
