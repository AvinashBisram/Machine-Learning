Machine Learning Projects
=========================

This repository will contain projects involving the three main machine learning models: Regression, Classification, and Clustering.
**Language(s):** Python  
**Package(s):** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn  
**Software:** Jupyter Notebooks

Projects Coming Soon:
---------------------
* Regression: Compares the performance of 3 Regression models (Linear, Polynomial, and Logistic) in predicting continuous outcomes based on historic labeled data (evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Squared Error).
* Classification: Compares the performance of 5 Classification models (KNN, SVM, Single Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and GradientBoost) in predicting categorical outcomes based on historic labeled data (evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy).
* Clustering: Implements 2 Clustering models (K-means, and DBSCAN) to group categorical outcomes based on their various fields.
