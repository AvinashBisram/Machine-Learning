Machine Learning Projects
=========================

This repository contains Python projects demonstrating the three main types of machine learning models: Regression, Classification, and Clustering.
<br>  
**Language(s):** Python  
**Package(s):** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Joblib  
**Software:** Jupyter Notebooks

Current Projects:
-----------------
* [Predicting Insurance Costs with Multiple Linear Regression](./Linear%20Regression): Creates, evaluates, and deploys a Multiple Linear Regression model capable of predicting insurance costs based on patient information (age, sex, bmi, smoking status, number of children, and region of residence). 

Projects Coming Soon:
---------------------
* **Poison Mushroom Classification**: Compares the performance of 7 Classification models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Single Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and GradientBoost) in predicting whether a mushroom is poisonous given information on appearance, odor, habitat, and more.
* **Clustering**: Compares 2 Machine Learning models (K-Means and DBSCAN) on their ability to group unlabeled data based on feature similarities.
